  <h1>Facilities</h1>
  <p>Maintaining Stability at Home</p>
</div>

Do you like knowing how things work, and how they can be built better, stronger, and faster? Do you consider an orderly home a cornerstone of stability? Do you enjoy work that involves a little elbow grease, ingenuity, and a drive to see it done __right__?

Then Facilities might be the place for you.

While progress is based on the twin fists of science and industry, neither of which is possible without a solid foundation to build atop of. We keep the lights on, run and stop the newspaper presses at a moment's notice and get the work that gets noticed only when it's not done right. An engineer's or groundskeeper's calling might not always be glamorous, but when it comes to the mundane or technical problems of modern living, we're the ones the Company turns to. Putting together and maintaining the Assembly's airship _The Marvelous Dragonfly_, ensuring that the Company can come home to hot water and a clean estate, and understanding the inner workings of the technology our Company finds or produces all fall upon our shoulders.
 
Qualifications:
* Desire to realize divisional roles ranging from housekeeping to creating the next big advancement in the Assembly's workshop
* Ability to adapt to interactions that can quickly involve the whole company
* Creative types who are comfortable around varied types of individuals from equally as varied backgrounds

_((OOC Note: The Facilities division regularly involves creating roleplay from non-game mechanic premises. While Disciples of the Hand can all call a home within this division, it should be noted that there is more to living in Eorzea than just what is synthesizable in the crafting menu.))_
