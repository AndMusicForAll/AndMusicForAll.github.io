  <p>Divisions & Running the Business</p>
</div>

The Halcyon Assembly is broken up into distinct Divisions that allow membership to define their role on both a day-to-date basis and what their long term duties are for serving the needs of the Company. From tending to our Lounge, the health of our Agents, ensuring the upkeep of the premises and informing the masses, each Division is designed to offer Agents a place to play to their existing strengths or offer the ability to grow into new skills and opportunities.

The Halcyon Assembly consists of the following Divisions:

* [Facilities](https://halcyon-assembly.enjin.com//facilities)
* [Library](https://halcyon-assembly.enjin.com//library)
* [Logistics](https://halcyon-assembly.enjin.com//logistics)
* [Lounge](https://halcyon-assembly.enjin.com//lounge)
* [Medical](https://halcyon-assembly.enjin.com//medical)
* [Publishing](https://halcyon-assembly.enjin.com/m/publishing)
* [Security](https://halcyon-assembly.enjin.com//security)

Membership of a Division does not bar Agents from engaging in activities with other Divisions. In fact, Agents are encouraged to seek out opportunities to be involved and assist others as necessary. Our structure allows for Agents to have a direct report for assignments, questions, suggestions, or issues in the form of the Division Head. These individuals are responsible for managing the day-to-day assignments of Agents and ensuring completion of assignments based on the needs of the Company or other Agents as necessary.

The Division Heads consist of the following:

* Facilities - Kletlona Sykurwyn
* Library - Kaetherlin Weisser
* Logistics - Iona Falconsoul
* Lounge - V'ara Obahn
* Medical - Orda Qalli
* Publishing - Okuni Tomioka
* Security - Claire Lionarm

New Hires are tasked with evaluating each Division over a two-sennight period to give them the opportunity to find where amongst the Company would suit them best. Division Heads are encouraged to reach out and interact with New Hires, as well, ensuring a smooth transition into their new role. The task of keeping Divisions on track and maintaining organization between them falls to the Directorate, which consists of the following:

* Iona Falconsoul
* V'ara Obahn
* Nachtiyrn Thosinsyn

Shaping, enacting, and monitoring the impact of policy and procedure are their bread and butter, ensuring that the overall goals and objectives of the Free Company are met. Working closely with the Proprietor, Casilmont Lavidien, the Directorate maintain the high-level management of Reverie and its functions, including hiring new Agents, forming and enforcing policy, and managing contracts and business dealings with external parties.
