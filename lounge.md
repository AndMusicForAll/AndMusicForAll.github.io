  <h1>Lounge</h1>
  <p>Serving and Connecting Eorzea's People with One Another</p>
</div>

It's been a day. Eorzea's workers, soldiers, adventurers and generals all require the same thing. Food, drink, and good company. This is the desire of Reverie's lounge, to ease the minds and bodies of all who enter our hall. Fresh ingredients, a wide selection of spirits, and good company with people that keep their fingers close to the pulse of all kinds of dealings, so long as they remain out of the underworld.
 
Our secondary focus is to offer a chance to those who would have none. This is achieved by either seating arrangements that would offer people the opportunity to associate and mingle, or even by offering a free meal and drink to those who find themselves on troubled times. All who would join in our cause, our goals, to grant succor to those who'd enter our halls will find their efforts well rewarded. Just please... Keep your shirt on, yes?
 
Qualifications:
* Understanding the menu and its ingredients
* Ability to defuse situations that could escalate into security's jurisdiction.
* Good communication skills that would assist you in aiding your fellow lounge workers.
 
_Notes: (OOC: Lounge is a fairly open ended division, you can help and participate with happenings without being a part of the division, nor does being part of the division exclude you from helping or even joining others. All who wish to help may do so, but as said before... Keep a clean shirt on.)_
