### Too Long; Didn't Read Summary
* Sign up on Enjin event to guarantee spot
* Turn order determined by party leader
* new members added to end
* outside loot belongs to map owner
* inside loot is FFA except Thief's Maps and gender-locked items
* rinse and repeat until dead

### So who gets to go?
Sign ups on the Enjin Event Calendar are open to everyone! Attendance is first come first serve, meaning that if there are more than eight people ready at the start time, a second group will be formed and filled. If not, they will be held in reserve as first to retrieve a spot in the event someone has to drop out (or elects to swap their spot for another in waiting). Those who have signed up on the Enjin Event Calendar receive priority over those who are just logged in at the time, so sign up on Enjin to guarantee a spot! A second group also has the option of tackling Aquapolis (see note at bottom) if they are short handed.

### So who goes when?
To keep things consistent and moving at a reasonable pace, the Party Leader/Host will pick the turn order as displayed in their Party UI. If someone has to drop out, anyone who replaces them will be placed at the end of the existing turn order. People who rejoin will also be added back at the end of the current turn order. Once it is your turn, you will link the location of your map in party chat and everyone will head that way, regardless of its location. The purpose of this is to ensure that all participants get to do their own map at least once. This also make it way easier to keep track of where we're going given that only one map will be linked. Please do not link your map unless you are directly asking for assistance in trying to locate it.

An exception to this can occur if anyone has a Timeworn Thief's Map - the party can, at unanimous agreement, opt to take this map in lieu of the next person's in turn order. Multiple Timeworn Thief's Maps can be tackled in succession if the party wishes to continue trying their luck.

#### Who gets what loot?
When digging up the treasure (hereafter referred to as "outside loot"), all other party members should greed. Outside loot belongs to the map owner. If you desire a particular item, communicate with the owner to have it traded to you after-the-fact. If the item isn't tradeable, indicate to the party you would like to roll on it to see if anyone is willing to pass. The map owner has final say on outside loot, however.

If a portal opens, any loot found inside the instance is considered "inside loot" and is free-for-all with two exceptions:

* Any Timeworn Thief's Map drop goes to the owner of the map that opened the instance.
* Any gender-locked items are to be rolled as Greed to allow the opposite gender the opportunity of the value of the item.

After the last person in the list has had their opportunity to use their map, the order will be maintained and started back with the first. This is an excellent opportunity for quick breaks for food, drink, repairs, etc. before beginning anew. Maps runs generally run until the group has collectively had their fill. In the event some members still wish to continue but cannot fulfill a full team, 7 or even 6 with the right composition can continue onward. Additionally, Aquapolis maps (Timeworn Dragonskin) generally only require five (in my experience) party members, as long as there's at least one healer and one tank.

If there are any questions, feel free to DM one of the admins and we'll be glad to help!
