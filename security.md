  <h1>Security</h1>
  <p>Protecting Eorzea At All Costs</p>
</div>
You're a fighter. 
It may have started in your youth, it may have been thrust upon you as you grew, but either way you know your way around a blade and it's kept you alive for now. There are no arenas here, no grand battlefields to earn glory, no alleyways to make gil off brawls. Here we serve but one purpose.

Protect.

We are the vanguard, the shield wall, the gleam of the headsman's axe against any who would make wrongdoings against members of our company, or against the wellbeing of Eorzea's denizens herself.
Welcome to Security, the plate-mail clad wall between our scholars and journalists and everything with sharp claws and teeth that hide in the dark. If you plan to be in here, you'll learn quick that you either follow orders, or find a new Division. 

Qualifications:
* Some sort of combat background: Military, Marauding, Gladiator sport, or just Adventuring
* Show up at to Lounge nights for detail, attend events or respond to linkpearl calls when you can
