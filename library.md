  <p>Acquiring and Presenting Knowledge</p>
</div>
Our first and foremost desire is to ultimately spread knowledge. We offer a number of services to assist with this which includes, but is not limited to, our telescope, handicraft facilities, and of course our library and book lending policies. While books are important to sharing and spreading knowledge, they are not everything. We also offer a number of classes. These are mostly limited to reading, writing and other basic skills but can include language, history and a number of other topics if the interest arises.

Our second focus is to uncover and understand knowledge. In a place that has seen as many disasters as Eorzea, much has been lost to time. In addition to the facilities mentioned above, we also have an archaeological branch which focuses primarily on this task. This branch organizes, initiates and oversees excursions into the field to uncover, retrieve and ultimately understand information lost to us over the ages.

There’s a story burning within you. Not necessarily your own, but perhaps one you overheard on a casual night out with friends; something dear to your own personal goals; a comment tossed out offhandedly that you wish to investigate further. There are stories told within each dark alley, behind some forgotten cabin, and under that half-rotted dock that you can’t help but be interested in. You are the sort to take notes, to take interest, to take a moment to write down something that others deem inconsequential. You have stories from all corners of the realm, and they need to be told.

Welcome to The Looking Glass, the newspaper of The Halcyon Assembly. We’re not a two-gil rag spewing idle gossip and baseless rumors; rather, we pride ourselves on finding all the timely, accurate, and relevant news fit to print. From parties to persecution, masquerades to manhandling, taverns to treason; we are the paper that has a space for every writer. If you’ve been fearing your words aren’t worthy, seek us out; we have confidence that this could be the newsroom you’ve been looking for.
