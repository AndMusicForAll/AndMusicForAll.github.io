  <h1>Library</h1>
  <p>Acquiring and Presenting Knowledge</p>
</div>
Our first and foremost desire is to ultimately spread knowledge. We offer a number of services to assist with this which includes, but is not limited to, our telescope, handicraft facilities, and of course our library and book lending policies. While books are important to sharing and spreading knowledge, they are not everything. We also offer a number of classes. These are mostly limited to reading, writing and other basic skills but can include language, history and a number of other topics if the interest arises.

Our second focus is to uncover and understand knowledge. This is unlike Logistics, which has a number of members looking forward to uncover the new, we instead look back. In a place that has seen as many disasters as Eorzea, much has been lost to time. In addition to the facilities mentioned above, we also have an archaeological branch which focuses primarily on this task. This branch organizes, initiates and oversees excursions into the field to uncover, retrieve and ultimately understand information lost to us over the ages.
