  <p>The Healing Hands of Reverie</p>
</div>
Here at Halcyon Assembly we have so many fun events and there's no shortage of action and danger! But what about the aftermath, you ask? 

That, my friends, is where Medical Division comes in! 

No good company is without the healers, the menders, and helping hands. Sure, we’re all helping each other on a daily basis but our line of work is so much more than a pat on the back! We cater to a wide variety of injuries and maladies: from papercuts, to crushed bones, even having an entire cave system dropped atop your head! We even treat matters such as infection, disease, or even hauntings!

Unskilled, untrained? Don’t worry! Our team of various backgrounds and expertise will happily teach you what they know to help you help yourself (or others)!

We attend most events ourselves or wait at the house on standby so we can always ready for action! Because while our Agents protect us on the front lines of battle, we are the ones maintaining a silent vigil by their bedsides. We are the soft smiles and murmured words who gently guide them back to health and hold their hand in the dead of night. All our efforts focus upon getting them right back out there on the front lines.

So what do you say? Dare to step into the clinic and see for yourself who the staff really are?
