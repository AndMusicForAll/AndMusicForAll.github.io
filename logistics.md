  <p>Procuring Goods and Maintaining Stability at Home</p>
</div>
Enjoy traveling and shopping? You're in luck, as that is exactly what we do in Operations! The best part is that it's not even our own gil, but the company's!
Our job is to keep the inventory filled at Reverie so that the lounge never serves empty cups, the clinic never runs out of bandages, the press has enough ink to keep on printing and that the library has enough ink and quills for their research.

Do you like knowing how things work, and how they can be built better, stronger, and faster? Do you consider an orderly home a cornerstone of stability? Do you enjoy work that involves a little elbow grease, ingenuity, and a drive to see it done __right__?

Then Operations might be the place for you.

While progress is based on the twin fists of science and industry, neither of which is possible without a solid foundation to build atop of. We keep the lights on, run and stop the newspaper presses at a moment's notice and get the work that gets noticed only when it's not done right. An engineer's or groundskeeper's calling might not always be glamorous, but when it comes to the mundane or technical problems of modern living, we're the ones the Company turns to. Putting together and maintaining the Assembly's airship _The Marvelous Dragonfly_, ensuring that the Company can come home to hot water and a clean estate, and understanding the inner workings of the technology our Company finds or produces all fall upon our shoulders.

### Qualifications
- Desire to realize divisional roles ranging from housekeeping to creating the next big advancement in the Assembly's workshop
- Ability to adapt to interactions that can quickly involve the whole company
- Creative types who are comfortable around varied types of individuals from equally as varied backgrounds
