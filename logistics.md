  <p>Procuring Goods and Negotiating Deals</p>
</div>
Enjoy traveling and shopping? You're in luck, as that is exactly what we do in Logistics! The best part is that it's not even our own gil, but the company's!
Our job is to keep the inventory filled at Reverie so that the lounge never serves empty cups, the clinic never runs out of bandages, the press has enough ink to keep on printing and that the library has enough ink and quills for their research.

### How We Operate
Simple enough! While we do enjoy a reliable sources for provisions, we also enjoy hunting the best deals for goods and services. For example:

_In Gridania, a cotton farmer and weaver had been working together in an attempt to make a more sticky cotton thread for medical use by using this thread weaving bandages. With the sticky thread the idea was that the bandages would be easier to apply, especially if your patients have a habit of not sticking to bedrest. 
One of our agents, Kureja, went out and tested the product. While it was an interesting idea, the price of actually producing such a bandaid seemed to outweigh the benefit of using them on a regular basis. So, the outcome of his field assignment was that it would not be worth investing in and making the change._

Another thing Logistics is used for is providing a stepping stone for larger plots for the FC down the road. Something that will start small, but escalate as we go. For example:
_On one of the trade trips to Kugane, Iona picked up an item from a small store. The shopkeep told her about a story following this item. Iona returns to Reverie and brings the item to Kaetherlin who, in return will have her department research it further. From there on out, adventure!_

Does this sound like something you would enjoy? Well, Logistics may just be the spot for you then! 

### Examples Roles/Positions

### OOC Note
Minor assignments will function as behind the scene adventure. Assignments are given and then it is up to you to write the report and think of a reasonable outcome, such as the first example above. Other times, like the second, involve more direct roleplay opportunity.
