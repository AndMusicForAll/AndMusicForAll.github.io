Enjoy traveling and shopping? Lucky you, that is exactly what we are doing in Logistics! Best part is, it is not even our own gil, but the company's.
Our job is to keep the inventory filled at Reverie, so the lounge never dries up, the clinic never runs out of bandages, the press got enough ink to keep on printing and that the library have enough ink and quills for their research.

How do we do this?  Simple enough, while I do enjoy a reliable source I also enjoy hunting out better deals than what we already got. Let me give you an example…

_In Gridania, a cotton farmer and weaver had been working together in a try to make a more sticky cotton thread for medical use by using this thread weaving bandages. With the sticky thread the idea was that the bandages would be easier to apply, especially if your patients have a habit of not sticking to bedrest. 
One of our agents, Kureja, went out and tested the product. While it was an interesting idea, the price of actually producing such a bandaid seemed to outweigh the benefit of using them on a regular basis. So, the outcome of his field assignment was that it would not be worth investing in and making the change._

Another thing Logistics will be used for is stepping stone into a larger plot for the FC in the future. Something that will start small, but escalate as we go. For example:
_On one of the trade trips to Kugane, Iona picked up an item from a small store, the person selling it told her about some story following this item. Iona returns to Reverie and brings the item to Kaeth who, in return will have her department research it further… from there on out, adventure!_

Does this sound like something you would enjoy? Well, logistics may just be the spot for you then! 

### OOC Note
I will give a fair warning, minor assignments will function as behind the scene adventure, I give the assignment and then it is up to you to write the report and think of a reasonable outcome. Like the scenario you read above. Other times, of course, it will be actual rp
